#POD:
#       - A pod represents a single instance of the application, and is the smallest 
#         compute unit in Kubernetes.
#
#       - A pod contains of one or more containers deployed together on a single host,
#         which means they share the same network space, and mount the same external storage. 
#        
#       - Pods are assigned to run on a node, and run until their containers exit or are removed.
#        
#       - Once a Pod goes down, it cannot bring itself back up on its own (does not self-heal),
#         which is why we use them with ReplicaSets/ReplcationControllers which can handle this.
